> release "v0.7.0"

- **Bulletproof Process Cleanup (Windows Job Objects)**:
  - Developed and integrated a native C++ module to leverage Windows Job Objects.
  - Guaranteed termination: All child and descendant processes are now hardware-terminated by the OS if the main application exits or crashes.
  - No more Orphans: Completely eliminates the possibility of orphaned processes or "zombies" on Windows.
- **Robust Media & Icon Engine**:
  - Rewrote the `media://` protocol handler for 100% reliability across all Windows drive letters (G:, D:, etc.).
  - Added support for multiple path formats (encoded, raw, and hostname-based) to ensure cross-partition icons load every time.
  - Enhanced MIME type detection for expanded image format support (.bmp, .tiff, etc.).
- **UI Responsiveness & Performance**:
  - **Input Debouncing**: Added intelligent debouncing (400ms) to icon and path inputs. Prevents UI "freezing" by waiting for the user to finish typing before attempting to load or validate files.
  - **Fast Exit Logic**: Streamlined the application shutdown sequence for a snappier feel while safely cleaning up database states.
- **Improved Windows Native Integration**:
  - Implemented ASAR-aware native module loading for seamless production builds.
  - Added smart path sanitization for pasted file paths (stripping quotes and trailing slashes).
- **Bug Fixes & Stability**:
  - Resolved `net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` when accessing icons on non-system partitions.
  - Fixed a critical issue where rapid typing in settings could cause the main process to hang.

> release "v0.5.0"

- **State Management Overhaul (Jotai)**:
  - Migrated entire frontend to Jotai atoms for robust global state management.
  - Significant performance gains by eliminating redundant re-renders in the project list and status updates.
- **Enhanced System Tray Integration**:
  - **Dynamic Context Menu**: Real-time sync between project status and tray controls.
  - **Bulk Management**: Introduced "Start All" and "Stop All" functionality directly from the tray.
  - **Granular Control**: Individual server submenus for Start/Stop/Restart without opening the main window.
- **Real-Time Notification System**:
  - Integrated `react-toastify` for instant visual feedback on all major actions.
  - Passive notifications: Get notified of status changes even if they were triggered from the tray.
  - Success/Error alerts for file operations, project management, and global settings.
- **Frameless Window Experience**:
  - Implemented modern frameless design with custom drag regions.
  - Visual Polish: Added backdrop-blur/glassmorphism effects to the sidebar for a premium aesthetic.
  - Smart Layout: Fixed component overlaps with system controls for a cleaner interface.
- **Project Enhancements**:
  - **Minecraft Server Support**: Added dedicated support with optimized Java startup scripts.
  - **Improved Settings Flow**: Project settings dialog now stays open after save for better iterative configuration.
  - **Component Refactoring**: Cleaned up the codebase by extracting dialogs (e.g., `AddProjectDialog`) into dedicated components.
- **Stability & Internal Fixes**:
  - Resolved race conditions in process resource monitoring.
  - Hardened status broadcasting system for 100% consistency across all application layers.

> release "v0.4.6"

- **Media Protocol Improvements**: Fixed a critical bug where project icons on non-system partitions (e.g., G:, D:) or in folders with spaces failed to render. Improved URL decoding logic in the backend handlers.

> release "v0.4.5"

- **Full Material Icon Theme Integration**:
  - Integrated 1,100+ high-quality SVG icons.
  - Comprehensive mapping logic for 3,100+ file extensions, filenames, and folder structures.
  - Robust icon fallback system using Lucide for generic files/folders.
- **Improved Asset Loading**: Hardened `media://app` protocol for secure and fast local asset loading.
- **Project-Specific Editor State**: Isolated "last opened file" state per project, ensuring a clean context when switching between servers.
- **Visual Polish**: Replaced generic file tree icons with context-aware Material Icons and improved animations.
- **Framer Motion Upgrade**: Updated all motion components to use `motion.create()` for better performance and future-proofing.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Resolved `net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` and `net::ERR_UNEXPECTED` errors on Windows.
  - Fixed `ReferenceError` for `useMemo` in the File Tree.

> release "v0.4.2"

- **Major Process Management Upgrade**: Replaced basic PID tracking with robust Process Groups (Unix) and PowerShell-based tree inspection (Windows).
- **Accurate Resource Aggregation**: Real-time CPU and RAM usage now sums up the entire process tree (Vite, Nodemon, child shells, etc.).
- **Dynamic Supervisor Detection**: Intelligent detection of process managers (Vite, Nodemon, PM2, etc.) via `package.json` resolution and live tree inspection.
- **Tree-Safe Shutdown**: Guaranteed cleanup of all child processes when stopping a project, preventing orphaned "zombies".
- **Performance Optimizations**: Snapshot-based process lookup and batch `pidusage` for minimal overhead.

> release "v0.4.0"
